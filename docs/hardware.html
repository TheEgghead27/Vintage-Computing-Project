<h1> Influential Computer Models </h1>
<h2 id="ibmPC"> IBM PC </h2>
    <p>
        <img src="images/ibmpc.jpg" align="left" alt="An image of the IBM PC.">
        The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_birth.html">IBM PC</a> may just be a footnote in the success of Microsoft, but it was a revolutionary device for its time.
        Although "personal computers" had existed since the 70s, in 1980, IBM set out to make its own personal computer project to compete on the new market.
        Prior to this period, computers were mainly large, clunky mainframes that cost millions, along with terminals that cost thousands for enterprise offices.
        The IBM PC was a massive success, mainly because of how much quicker and cheaper it was compared to previous IBM products.
        IBM also did something completely unusual for the time, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/personalcomputer/">make their computer specifications openly documented.</a>
        This allowed other hardware manufacturers to follow in IBM's footsteps, and the "IBM Compatible" label became commonplace.
        This kicked off the Microsoft software-based personal computing industry that we still know today.

<h2 id="mac"> Apple Macintosh </h2>
    <p>
        <img src="images/Macintosh.jpg" align="left" alt="An image of the Apple Macintosh.">
        In 1879, Apple employee Jef Raskin wanted to make a computer that the common man would be able to afford and use.
        He was going to name the device after his favorite apple type, the McIntosh, but due to the name being trademarked already, it became the <a href="https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Macintosh.html">Macintosh</a>.
        Raskin took a few workers from the other computer project Apple was investing in, the Lisa, as they were making a similar device that was simply more expensive.
        By incorporating less RAM into the design, the Macintosh was able to stay much cheaper than the Lisa.
        At this point, Steve Jobs realized how the Macintosh was much more prospective, and he began to contribute.
        However, Raskin's design decisions disagreed with that of his boss, so Raskin left the project.
        Steve Jobs managed to negotiate a trade with Xerox where Xerox would get some Apple stock in return for Apple being able to see some of their user interface designs.
        This became the GUI (graphic user interface) focused Macintosh, which we still recognize in its modern form.

<h2 id="c64"> Commodore 64 </h2>

        In 1981, Albert Charpentier from <a href="http://www.commodore.ca/commodore-history/the-rise-of-mos-technology-the-6502/"> MOS Technology,</a> a chip provider to companies like Atari, Commodore, Nintendo, and Texas Instruments, wanted to make the next video and sound chips for the next great video games.
        In November of that year, the chips had been designed, but the Commodore president decided to not use them in the declining video game market.
        Instead, a <a href="https://www.commodore.ca/commodore-products/commodore-64-the-best-selling-computer-in-history/"> consumer personal computer with 64 kilobytes of RAM</a> would be created and shown at the January 1982 Consumer Electronics Show.
        By August of 1982, the Commodore 64 was in full production and distribution.
        The lower price point of the computer ("under $600" in a time where most computers were at MRSPs above or at the $999/$1000 price point) was the main appeal of the C64.
        The operating system allowed for BASIC programs to be easily created and executed, essential parts of hardware, like the monitor, were built in.
        All of these consumer-friendly qualities earned it the world record for <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/72695-most-computer-sales"> most sold computer model, with over 10 million units sold</a>.
